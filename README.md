# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project was to utilize our new skillset in HTML/CSS to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres/titles of those images, store the scraped data in a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Initial Code
We began the project by using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images. See code below for details:

## Mars Hemispheres
We then used Python/HTML to add the code created to the scraping.py file. We updated the Mongo database, and modified the index.html file. The webpage contained all the information collected as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

## Device Accessible & HTML Style
Lastly, we updated the web app to make it mobile-responsive, and added two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out (orange button & updated table).

## Conclusions
The final project produced highlighted our skills in HTML/CSS/Python/Mongo in a styled webpage.
